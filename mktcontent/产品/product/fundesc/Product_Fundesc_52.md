[{"funcName":"Simple and Easy-to-use Visual Modeling","funcContent":[{"funcName":"","funcTitle":"","funcP":"The algorithm, data and model are componentized, and the task flow is constructed and the model is built by dragging and dropping such components which can be combined flexibly. Data streams are transferred through the wires between components and are automatically perceived. Format of component input and output data is verified automatically, with smart alert."}]},{"funcName":"Abundant Component Library","funcContent":[{"funcName":"","funcTitle":"","funcP":"Support main frameworks such as TensorFlow, BigDL, Caffe, Xgboost and so on. Various built-in mature deep learning algorithms such as CNN, DNN can be applied to image operation and natural language processing."}]},{"funcName":"Flexible Operating Mode","funcContent":[{"funcName":"","funcTitle":"","funcP":"A modeling experiment supports the construction of multiple topological model structures to run at the same time; the nodes that are running successfully do not need to be executed repeatedly, and support to start the running from the intermediate nodes of the task flow; support the re-execution of any running version that is called."}]}]
