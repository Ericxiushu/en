The payment is made based on the current capacity and type of the cloud disk, and the capacity of the cloud disk can be expanded at any time according to the service development;</br> 3) 3.	The IOPS and throughput of the cloud disk is monitored in a real-time manner to keep informed of the performance status of the cloud disk."
