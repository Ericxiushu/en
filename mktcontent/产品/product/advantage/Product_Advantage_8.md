When a fault occurs on the host node, the standby node is upgraded to become the new host node to provide services continuously; the persistent service data and instance allocation across availability zones ensure data security and continuous operation of services.",

		"proName":"The one-button scalability is convenient and fast. The automatic scalability is carried out according to the service conditions and is selected and upgraded as required, so as to improve the resource utilization ratio and lower the redundancy costs; you can log on to the console for scalability, and the whole process will not influence your on-line business.",

Therefore, it has a superior performance over the relational database; the protection at the source code level and ultra-high performance are able to satisfy your requirements on most scenarios; it supports most Redis commands and easily copes with business demands on Redis high capacity or high performance; it provides cluster type extended Redis performance and breaks the performance bottleneck of the Redis single-threaded mechanism.",
