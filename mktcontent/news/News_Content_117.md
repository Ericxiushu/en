Mr. Liu Yimin, executive director of Changzhou Agricultural Products Industry Association, said in his speech that agriculture is one of the core fields of "the Internet + Action Plan". Under the background of agricultural supply-side reform, we must change our ideas for agricultural development and innovate for agricultural development models. The Internet provides a rare historical opportunity and means for the development of the agricultural product industry. It is necessary to seize the opportunity of "corner overtaking" of the Internet to enable agricultural products enterprises of Changzhou entering the big market. This measure is like adding a wing to these agricultural products, and they will fly to the whole country, even the whole world. It is hoped that JD's advanced concepts, superior technologies and resources can be carried to agricultural products enterprises of Changzhou to help "accelerated running" of the development of traditional agricultural products enterprises so that agricultural products of Changzhou can enter into the ever-changing big market, which is of great significance for promoting agricultural products enterprises to improve quality and efficiency and expand sales channels. It is hoped that more local agricultural products enterprises can seize this opportunity and embrace the Internet + new economy with the attitude of "openness, symbiosis and mutual benefit".
