At present, JD Cloud provides you a variety of ways to manage JD Cloud resources: console page operation, JD Cloud SDK or CLI tools to directly call API for business configuration. As an important complement to the console page operating mode, the JD Cloud CLI tool is based on OpenAPI metadata auto-generation to help you easily manage the command-line tools for JD Cloud  resources. Through it, you can quickly call out JD Cloud API, do automation and script processing, combine and reuse cloud resources in a variety of ways. At present, there are more than ten business lines supporting VM, network, container and so on. JD Cloud CLI features the following features:

1. Support cross-platform. The CLI is currently supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems.
2. It can only be used after authentication. Before use, apply for JD Cloud AccessKey and SecretKey (hereinafter referred to as AK/ SK, for details  view: AccessKey Management Page).
3. Depends on the JD Cloud Python SDK.
