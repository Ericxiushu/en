
# Introduction #
  Welcome to the JD Cloud Developer Node.js Tool Kit (Node.js SDK). Use JD Cloud. Node.js SDK, you can access various services from JD Cloud without complex programming. 

  To help you understand the meaning of some of the concepts and parameters in the SDK, we recommend that you first review[JD Cloud OpenAPI Use Getting Started] before using the SDK (http://www.jdcloud.com/help/detail/355/isCatalog/0). To understand the specific parameters and meanings of each API, refer to the program comments or the API documentation for specific product lines under the OpenAPI & SDK.



# Environment Preparation #
 1. The JD Cloud Node.js SDK is applicable to Node.js 8.6. 0 and above, npm 5.6.0 and above.

 2. Before apply for JD Cloud open API, [AccessKey management page](https://uc.jdcloud.com/accesskey/index) shall be called out for application of accesskey and secretKey Key Pair (AK/SK). AK/ SK information shall be kept properly and if lost, it is likely to cause illegal users to use this information to operate your resources on the cloud, resulting data or property losses.



# SDK usage method #
It is recommended to install the JD Cloud Node.js SDK using npm as follows: 

npm install jdcloud-sdk-js

 

You can also download the sdk source code yourself. The source code address is:[Node.js SDK](https://github.com/jdcloud-api/jdcloud-sdk-nodejs).

 

With any of the problems in the SDK use, you welcome you to communicate with the Github project[SDK Use Problem Feedback page](https://github.com/jdcloud-api/jdcloud-sdk-nodejs/issues).



Note: JD Cloud does not provide other downloading ways, please be sure to use the above-mentioned official download method!

 

# Call SDK #

## Two reference modes: ##
	var JDCloud = require('jdcloud-sdk-js');

This reference mode loads all available services



	var NC = require('jdcloud-sdk-js/services/nc');

This reference mode only loads the service that is used, and you can still use var. Cloud = request ('jdcloud-sdk-js/.') to reference SourceCloud object
## 
Configuration Method ##
Configure the JDCloud as a common configuration with all services sharing configurations:


	JDCloud.config.update ({/ * Configuration Item */});


The configuration for a service overrides the general configuration: 


	var NC = require('jdcloud-sdk-js/services/nc');
	var nc = new NC ({/*Configuration Item*/});


## Configuration Item ##
	let config = {
	    credentials:{
	        accessKeyId,
	        secretAccessKey,
	    },
	    regionId,   //region information, an api call can be referred to as a single reference regionId, and if the call is not passed, the regionId in this configuration is used
	}


## Call sample ##
The following is an example of a call to query details for individual VM Instance

	var VM = require('jdcloud-sdk-js/services/vm')
	
	var vm = new VM({
	  credentials: {
	    accessKeyId: global.accessKeyId,
	    secretAccessKey: global.secretAccessKey
	  },
      version: {
	    vm: 'v1'
      },
	  regionId: 'cn-north-1'
	})
	
	vm.createInstances({
	    instanceSpec: {
	      instanceType: 'g.s1.micro',
	      az: 'cn-north-1a',
	      imageId: '98d44a0f-88c1-451a-8971-f1f769073b6c',
	      name: 'node-sdk-test',
	      elasticIp: { bandwidthMbps: 2, provider: 'BGP' },
	      primaryNetworkInterface: {
 	       networkInterface: {
	          subnetId: 'subnet-3dm13k30gh',
	          az: 'cn-north-1a'
	        }
	      },
	      systemDisk: { diskCategory: 'local' },
	      description: 'sdk'
	    },
	    maxCount: 1
	  }, 'cn-north-1')
