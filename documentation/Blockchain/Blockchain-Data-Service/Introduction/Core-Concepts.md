# Core concept
See the following for the terminologies and their interpretation used in the help documentation of JD Cloud block chain data service for reference.

| Terminology        | Interpretation                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Region            | Region is a collection of infrastructure services within a scope located at a close geographic position. Cloud service products at the same region can be connected to each other through the internal low-delay network of the cloud service provider; businesses of cloud service at different regions are independent from each other and generally connected to each other by public network. Note: the intranets in different regions are not connected to each other |
| Availability Zone          | Availability zone is a physical region where power and network are independent of each other. Instances at the same availability zone have less network delay than instances at different availability zones in a same region. Different availability zones in a same region provide an environment for intranets to connect to each other while there is fault isolation between availability zones |
| Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) | A logically isolated network space customized by users on JD Public Cloud. This private network space is fully controlled by users and supports customized network segmentation and routing policies. Users can create and manage multiple cloud products in the VPC, such as virtual machine, load balancer, etc., and configure resources within the network to connect to the Internet |
| Subnet | A subnet is an IP address block within the IP address range of the virtual private cloud (VPC) to which it belongs. The subnet is under the VPC. After creating a VPC, users can add subnets under the VPC. IP address blocks of subnets under the same VPC cannot overlap, and IP address blocks of subnets under different VPCs can overlap |
|Database|A logical unit created under an instance. An instance can create several databases and these databases are uniquely named in the instance|
|Account|A logical unit created under an instance. An instance can create several accounts and these accounts are uniquely named in the instance|
|Instance|A database service process separately occupying CPU and memory resources, by which users can create database services of different specifications, disk space and types as required|
| Data Source          |A block chain data type needs to be synchronized. We only provided BTC and ETH currently and will provide more in the future|
