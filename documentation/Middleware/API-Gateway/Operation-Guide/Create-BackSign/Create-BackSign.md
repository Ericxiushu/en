# Backend Service Signature


Currently, the API gateway configures security protection settings for you, providing two security measures: Backend signature key pair and traffic control policy. This paper will introduce the backend signature.

The key pair of backend signature adopts JD Cloud User AK/SK(Access Key/Access Key Secret), which will protect your backend through verification of backend signature when the gateway requests your real backend.

After you associate the AK/SK key pair of JD Cloud user to API, this AK/SK will be added and showed when the gateway requests this API, and your backend will verify the identity of gateway through verification of string of signature.
