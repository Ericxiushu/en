# Infrastructure

Advanced anti-DDoS is the pay-added service that launched when the Internet server is not available after being attacked by large traffic of DDoS attacks.

The user opens the service of advanced anti-DDoS, and the configurations lead the IP addresses visited by the user to the IP address provided by the advanced anti-DDoS. By carrying out real-time detection and cleaning of all abnormal traffic through the advanced anti-DDoS service, it ensures that only the normal flow can be returned to the user server, thus ensuring the stability and reliability of the source station.

## Advanced Anti-DDoS Unaccessed
When the advanced anti-DDoS is unaccessed, all the normal and abnormal visits will arrive directly to the source station. In case of DDoS attacks, the source station can be easily broken down.

## After Advanced Anti-DDoS Access
After access to advanced anti-DDoS business, all access traffics to the source station will be detected in real time through Advanced Anti-DDoS. The advanced anti-DDoS has strong protection mechanism, and can only re-inject the cleaned traffic to the source station after going through the traffic cleaning at advanced protection machine room and the four-layer and seven-layer attacks are filtered off.
