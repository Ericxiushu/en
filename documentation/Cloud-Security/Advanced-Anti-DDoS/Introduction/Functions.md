# Product Features

The advanced anti-DDoS provides high-capacity attack protection, can effectively resist various large-traffic DDoS attacks, and supports the defense against attack of layer 3 to 7 layers.

## Main Functions of Advanced Anti-DDoS Include:

### 1. Management and configuration
- Supports the creation of advanced anti-DDoS instance, and can manage the created advanced protection instance.

### 2. Supports forwarding configuration
- Support the creation of non-web-based (IP address) and web-based (domain) forwarding rules;
- Supports the forwarding configuration of TCP, UDP, HTTP and HTTPS protocols, websocket protocols, multiple-IP back-to-source, and domain name back-to-source.

### 3. Multiple protection configuration rules
- Supports IP black list/white list, URL white list, CC automatic protection and custom protection configurations for fine protection.
- Supports advanced web-based configurations such as non-standard port access, HTTP address forcible back-to-source, HTTP visit jump, etc.

### 4. Flexible protection billing scheme
- Supports elastic protection. Saves costs for you by billing by the actual attack bandwidth.

### 5. Quick access
- Enables quick access to advanced anti-DDoS services in cname-based manner.

### 6. Massive attack protection
- Supports Telecom + Unicom + CMCC line, 400G of maximum single line capability, total defense capability of T level.

### 7. Accurate report display
- Provides you with a comprehensive understanding of advanced anti-DDoS services by presenting demonstrations such as DDoS attack reports, forwarding traffic, CC reports, etc.

### 8. Covered common attack types, see the following table:

| Attack Classification | Description | 
| :- | :- |
| Exception Filter  | Black list/TCP/UDP/other protocol load feature filterings |
| Protocol vulnerability & threat protection | IP Spoofing; LAND attack; Fraggle attack; Smurf attack; Winnuke attack; Ping of Death attack; Tear Drop attack; IP Option control attack; IP fragment control message attack; TCP tag legality detection attack; Oversize ICMP control message attack; ICMP redirection control message attack; ICMP unreachable control message attack |
| Scan pry threat protection | Port scan attack; Address scan attack; TRACERT control message attack; IP source station routing option attack; IP timestamp option attack; IP routing record option attack, etc. |
| Transport layer threat protection | SYN flood attack; ACK flood attack; SYN-ACK flood attack; FIN/RST flood attack; TCP fragment flood attack; UDP flood attack; UDP fragment flood attack; ICMP flood, etc. |
| Application threat protection | HTTP get /font attack; CC attack; HTTP slow header/post attack; HTTPS flood attack; SSL DoS/DDoS attack; TCP connection exhaustion attack; Sockstock attack; TCP retransmission attack; TCP null connection attack; SIP flood, etc. |
