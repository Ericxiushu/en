# Billing Instructions
The price of advanced anti-DDoS products is as follows, wherein the elastic protection is optional.


## Minimum Protection
The minimum bandwidth protection is of Pay-In-Advance mode monthly, specifically as follows:

DDoS protective capability (Gbps) | CC protection peak value (QPS) | Telecom cost (RMB/month) | Telecom + Unicom cost (RMB/month) | Telecom + Unicom + CMCC cost (RMB/month) |
:---|:--- |---: |---: |---:
| 10 | 30,000 | 6000 | 8000 | 10,000 |
|20|60,000|12,800|15,800|18,800|

## Business Bandwidth:
By default, 100 Mbps is gifted. You can purchase larger business bandwidth if needed. The business bandwidth and minimum protection have the same purchase cycle.
RMB 4000 per 50Mbps. 2000Mbps can be purchased at most.


- For better protection bandwidth, please contact the customer service.
