## **CC Protection**

Toggling the status button may control the switch of CC protection,

CC protection can choose two modes of normal or attack critical.

Normal mode: The default CC protection mode, employed when there is no obvious exception traffic on the website, to avoid mis-killing. Attack critical: When the website page is slow, traffic, CPU, memory and other indicators are exception, you can switch to this mode.
