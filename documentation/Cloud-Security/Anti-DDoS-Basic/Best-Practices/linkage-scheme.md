The Anti-DDoS Basic is a free service that JD Cloud provides to counter common cloud attacks. Provide up to 2G attack protection capabilities. For a DDoS attack that exceeds 2G attack traffic, a black hole is triggered, leading to that normal business cannot be accessed. In this case, the user can solve the problem by deploying the Anti-DDoS Basic plus Anti-DDoS Pro way. Under the condition that the attacking flow rate is less than 2G, Anti-DDoS Basic can finish the cleaning of the attack flow rate, and the cleaned flow rate can be re-injected. The attack flow exceeds 2G to Anti-DDoS Pro, and is protected by Anti-DDoS Pro.
