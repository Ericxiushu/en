# Product advantages

| Product advantages | VM of Elastic Network Interface | Ordinary VM |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Elastic plugging | Elastic Network Interface is elastically hot-pluggable on a VM. The Elastic Network Interfaces of JD Cloud support elastic hot plug in the operation state of Virtual Machines which can realize the addition and removal of Elastic Network Interfaces with no business disruption, facilitating you to create a more reliable application scheme | Ordinary Virtual Machine can only be attached with one network interface |
| Flexible reuse | The Virtual Machine can be allocated with several Elastic Network Interfaces, each of which can be allocated with several Private IP addresses The Elastic Network Interface of JD Cloud can be allocated with several Private IP addresses, each of which can be associated with a public IP address, so that a single VM can provide different service application scenarios | Ordinary VM can only be distributed one Private IP address and associated one public IP address |
| Business separation | Different Elastic Network Interfaces can host private network, public network and management network traffic respectively. JD Cloud VM can be attached with Elastic Network Interfaces of multiple subnets in the VPC. Different Elastic Network Interfaces host different traffics and provide solutions for such scenarios as virtual network devices and traffic separation etc. | One network interface of ordinary VM can host different business traffics |
| Security improvement | Different Security Group strategies can be applied to different Elastic Network Interfaces JD Cloud's Elastic Network Interfaces provide Security Group strategies at the network interface level. Different Elastic Network Interfaces can apply different Security Group strategies according to business traffic characteristics, realizing accurate management and control of business traffic and improving the security of solution | The same Security Group policy is applied for all business traffics of ordinary VM |
| Reliable fault tolerance | Elastic Network Interface supports dynamic migration between VMs in different Availability Zones. JD Cloud provides Elastic Network Interfaces without Availability Zone attribute, supports the dynamic migration of Elastic Network Interfaces between VMs of different Availability Zones, realizes the high availability scheme at the Availability Zone level, shortens the fault time, and improves the system reliability | Dynamic migration is not allowed for the network interface of ordinary VM |
