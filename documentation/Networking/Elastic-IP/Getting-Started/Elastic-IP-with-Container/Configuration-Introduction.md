# Configuration Description

This Tutorial will guide you to create a container in the Virtual Private Cloud and make the container associate Elastic IP to realize the containerâ€™s access to the public network. This Tutorial is applicable to the scenario where the container provides outward services.

## Before Creation

- Make sure you have registered your JD Cloud account and finished real-name verification.

- Make sure you have created an Elastic IP which has not associated resources.

## Action Steps

Step 1: create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Step 2: create a container instance based on VPC you have created.

Step 3: during the process of creating a container instance, you may choose to allocate an Elastic IP or no Elastic IP. This Tutorial is based on the allocation of no Elastic IP.

Step 4: make the container instance you have created associate Elastic IP in either container instance associating Elastic IP or Elastic IP associating container instance.

## Follow-up Tests

After the container instance associates the Elastic IP, you may test the connectivity of the Elastic IP by using Ping Elastic IP addresses.
