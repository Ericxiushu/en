# Configuration Description

This Tutorial will guide you to create a Load Balancer in the Virtual Private Cloud and make the Load Balancer associate Elastic IP to realize the diversion function of Load Balancer during the public networkâ€™s access to the Virtual Machine. This Tutorial is applicable to the scenario where a number of Virtual Machines provide outward services and the traffic distribution is required, such as large websites.

## Before Creation

- Make sure you have registered your JD Cloud account and finished real-name verification.

- Make sure you have created an Elastic IP which has not associated resources.

## Action Steps

Step 1: create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Step 2: create a Load Balancer based on VPC you have created.

Step 3: during the process of creating a Load Balancer, you may choose to allocate an Elastic IP or no Elastic IP. This Tutorial is based on the allocation of no Elastic IP.

Step 4: make the Load Balancer you have created associate Elastic IP in either Load Balancer associating Elastic IP or Elastic IP associating Load Balancer.

## Follow-up Tests

After the Load Balancer associates the Elastic IP, you may test the connectivity of the Elastic IP by using Ping Elastic IP addresses.
