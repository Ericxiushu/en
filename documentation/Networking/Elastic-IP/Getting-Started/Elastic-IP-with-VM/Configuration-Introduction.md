# Configuration Description

This Tutorial will guide you to create a Virtual Machine in the Virtual Private Cloud and make the Virtual Machine associate Elastic IP to realize the Virtual Machineâ€™s access to the public network. This Tutorial is applicable to the scenario where the Virtual Machine provides outward services, such as building websites, BBS and personal blogs.

## Before Creation

- Make sure you have registered your JD Cloud account and finished real-name verification.

- Make sure you have created an Elastic IP which has not associated resources.

## Action Steps

Step 1: create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Step 2: create a virtual machine based on VPC you have created.

Step 3: during the creation of a Virtual Machine instance, you may choose to allocate an Elastic IP or no Elastic IP. This Tutorial is based on the allocation of no Elastic IP.

Step 4: make the Virtual Machine you have created associate Elastic IP in either Virtual Machine associating Elastic IP or Elastic IP associating Virtual Machine.

## Follow-up Tests

After the Virtual Machine associates the Elastic IP, you may test the connectivity of the Elastic IP by using Ping Elastic IP addresses.
