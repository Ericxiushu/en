# Core Concept
The following concepts and interpretations used in the Elastic IP help documentation are Listed for reference.

| English | Chinese | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Elastic IP | Elastic IP | Elastic IP is Public IP that may be independently applied for, and supports dynamically associating and disassociating Virtual Machine, container, Load Balancer, and NFV Instance.
| Instance | Instance | Instance is a basic service unit of cloud computing provided by JD Cloud, providing computing services with flexible and auto scalable processing capacity. It includes CPU, memory, operating system, storage, network, and security. Every resource has a variety of specifications to choose to meet the personalized needs of different business. |
| NFV Instance | NFV Instance | NFV is short for Network Function Virtualization. NFV Instance is a virtual network device which has traditional network functions and is realized with the use of software technologies and virtualization technologies, such as VPN Gateway and NAT Gateway VM Instances created with image.|
| BGP | BGP | BGP is short for Border Gateway Protocol. Network operators declare IP address fields to each other through BGP protocol. BGP IP may realize single IP with multiple IP providers to achieve high-speed access by the users of different operators.|
| Region | Region | Different regions mean different geographic regions. Currently, JD Cloud has four regions: cn-north-1, cn-south-1, cn-east-1, and cn-east-2.
| AZ | AZ | AZ is short for Availability Zone. There may be a number of AZs in a regionï¼Œand the resources in different AZs are separated from each other to ensure their high availability. The AZs are normally interconnected by IP providers with low latency and high bandwidth.
| VPN Gateway | VPN Gateway | VPN is shot for Virtual Private Network. VPN Gateway is an Internet-based product that connect an enterprise data center to the cloud VPC in a secure manner with the channel encryption technology.
| NAT Gateway | NAT Gateway | NAT is short for Network Address Translator. NAT Gateway may provide access to enterprise-level VPC public network for users.
| Load Balancer | Load Balancer | The Load Balancer may distribute traffic to a number of Virtual Machines, improving application system availability by eliminating single points of fault.
