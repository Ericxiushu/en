## Pay by Configuration

### Introduction
Pay by configuration is a Pay-As-You-Go type. The billing period is one hour. According to the Elastic IP configuration you purchased and the actual usage time (accurate to the second) in the billing cycle, the cost of the previous period is calculated and deducted at each hour.
### Example

Then the fee (0.06*0.5=RMB 0.03) for the last hour (half hour actually used) will be settled at 11:00:00 on 2017-8-2, and settle the cost (RMB 0.06) per hour later, and settle the balance cost of the cycle when you delete the Elastic IP.
