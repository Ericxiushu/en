# Basic architecture

The bottom layer of the data visualization screen is supported by the key technologies of big data. It can perform complex statistics, mining analysis and linkage analysis of multiple indicators on data, and explore and display the value behind the data.
## 
The basic architecture of data visualization screen consists of 3 layers:<br>

1. Visual display layer<br>
Data visualization screen management: The users can perform functions such as copy and edit the created data visualization screen. <br>
Component management: The data visualization screen components adopt Echarts&HighCharts framework to provide users with various graphical representations of data such as column charts, line charts, maps, etc. In addition, users can also visually map data through attributes such as color and size of graphics to make data representations more vivid. <br>
Canvas editing: The users can generate the data visualization screen by creating the canvas. On the canvas, users can make layout, data binding, and interactive settings for the components of data visualization screen. <br>
  
2. Data control layer<br>
