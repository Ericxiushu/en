## Problem Analysis

The possible reason is that the link between the virtual machine and the MongoDB instance is disconnected.

## Problem Processing

1. Verify if the connection address of the MongoDB instance is correct.

   Locate the MongoDB instance on the MongoDB console and view the MongoDB connection address on the instance details page. Refer to: [Connection Instance] (./ Getting-Started/ Connect-Instance.md)

1. Verify if the virtual machine for connection is in the same VPC of the MongoDB instance.

   Check whether the virtual machine and MongoDB instance are in the same VPC on JD Cloud console. If they are in different VPC and are not connected through the VPC peering connection, then the internal network is not available. Please replace the virtual machine to connect the MongoDB instance.

1. Confirm whether the white list of the MongoDB instance limits the IP of the virtual machine?

   Locate the MongoDB instance on the MongoDB console to view its white list settings. Confirm if the intranet IP of the virtual machine is limited by the white list, if so, please add it to the white list.

1. Confirm if the security group rules for the virtual machine are limited.

   Locate the virtual machine on the virtual machine console to view its security group rules. If the outbound rule does not open port 27017, please add the rule:
   - Type: Customized TCP
   - Destination Port: 27017
   - Destination IP: 0.0. 0.0/ 0, because the IP may change during disaster tolerance switching or capacity expansion of MongoDB, please open all IP(s).

1. Verify if the network ACL used by the virtual machine and the subnet where MongoDB is located is limited.

   In the VPC console, find the network ACL used by the subnet where the virtual machine and MongoDB are located, and confirm whether the outbound rules and inbound rules are open for the port 27017. If not, add the rules:
   - Type: Customized TCP
   - Destination Port: 27017
   - Destination IP: 0.0. 0.0/ 0, because the IP may change during disaster tolerance switching or capacity expansion of MongoDB, please open all IP(s).
