# Create cloud disk snapshot

<br>

##  Operation instructions

Snapshot is a data backup method provided by JD Cloud. Snapshot reserves all the data on the cloud disk before a specified time point without occupying the userâ€™s storage space.



- The quota for snapshots of a single user under the same region is 15 blocks;



- To ensure the completeness of data, please stop writing the cloud disk before creating snapshot, in order to guarantee the completeness of snapshot data;



- Before creating snapshot, you are suggested to detach the cloud disk and attach it to the virtual machine again after creating snapshot;



- The life cycle of manual snapshot is independent from the cloud disk, please delete unnecessary snapshots in time;



- The time required for creating snapshot depends on the size of cloud disk capacity. The larger the cloud disk capacity is, the longer the time is;
