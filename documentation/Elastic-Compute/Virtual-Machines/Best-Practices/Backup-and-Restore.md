# Backup and Restoration

* Back up your cloud disk regularly with cloud disk snapshot and create a Private Image from your instance to save the configuration as a template for launching future instances.
* Deploy critical services across multiple availability zones to realize cross-region instance replication and backup through image replication.
* You can manually associate the Elastic Network Interface or Elastic IP Address to replacement instance to achieve a quick response to fault and shield the impact of the fault.
* Regularly test your instance and the restoration capability when the cloud disk has faults in a Test Environment.
