# Expand Cloud Disk

As your data increases, you can expand the cloud disk if its current capacity does not meet your needs.

## Service Limits

* To expand the cloud disk, you need to detach it from the instance to expand it and then attach it to the instance.
* It is recommended to take a snapshot of the data disk before expansion.
* If the cloud disk is under the state of snapshot production or data recovery, the expansion operation cannot be performed.
* The expansion only refers to expansion of disk capacity instead of file system. For details, refer to [Expand File System]().
* The original data remains after the expansion.

## Operation Steps
