# Bind Key Pair

Binding key pair refers to injecting the public key pair of the key pair into the corresponding instance, including the public key pair generated by the console or the public key pair uploaded to the console.

The current console only supports you to bind key pair when you create instance or rebuild for the instance. For details, please refer to [Create Instance](../Instance/Create-Instance.md) and [Rebuild](.. /Instance/Rebuild-Instance.md).

In addition, you can also configure the key pair on your own to log in to instance and refer to [SSH Login Configuration].
