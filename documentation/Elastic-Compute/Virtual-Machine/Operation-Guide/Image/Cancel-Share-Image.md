# Cancel Shared Private Image

## Precautions
* When unshared, the original shared user can no longer create instances with the image, and instances created with the image cannot be reset to the original system state.

## Operation Steps
1. Access [Image Console][1], or access [JD Cloud Console][2] Click navigation bar on the left [Elastic Compute] - [Virtual Machine] - [Image] to enter the image list page.
2. Select [Private] TAB and the private image you want to unshare in the list.
3. You can click [Shared Image] in the list operation column, select the account to be unshared from the shared account displayed in the pop-up window, click [Cancel Sharing] in the operation column, then the shared private image of the corresponding account is canceled, and the image will be automatically removed from the "Shared Image" list of the corresponding account. You can also click on the image name to enter the detail page, select the "Image Sharing" TAB to view the account shared by this image, and click [Cancel Sharing].
