## Classified Statistic of Resources

By describing the “tag” of the resource instance as much as possible for the resource mark, it can help users quickly and accurately count which resources are used under the current account and which tags are associated to these resources respectively.
## Resource Filtering

By describing the “tag” of the resource instance as much as possible for the resource mark, users can quickly filter a certain type of resource through the “tag” in the resource list of VM,  Cloud Disk Service and SQL Server, thereby batch management of such resources can be realized.
