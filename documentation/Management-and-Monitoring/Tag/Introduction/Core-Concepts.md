# Core Concept

**Tag**: Tags are tools for managing various types of resources. JD Cloud’s users can mark the resources of the same type or correlative resources through tags to facilitate various statistics and management tasks. For the resources in different regions or different Availability Zones, they can be classified by using the same tag. Each tag is composed of a pair of “key” and “value”.
For example, “Department: Basic R&D Department” is a tag; the “Department” is the “key” of the tag, and the “Basic R&D Department” is the value of this tag.
