## Application Scenarios

The Monitoring provides you with diversified customer scenarios:

## Daily Workload Monitoring Management
If the users need to monitor their own business, they are allowed to monitor the running status and usage of resources through the monitoring page of the purchased Cloud Service details page and the monitoring page of the Monitoring module. At the same time, the users are allowed to set alarm rules according to the characteristics of cloud resources. When the monitoring metric of the resource reaches the alarm threshold set by the users, an alarm is triggered, and a short message and an email alarm are sent to remind the users according to the contact information set by the users.
