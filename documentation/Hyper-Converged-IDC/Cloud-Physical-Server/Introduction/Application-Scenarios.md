# Application scenario
## Big Data
Set up a unified big data and computing platform based on Apache Hadoop framework to collect, store, analyze, search and dig mass data and find its intrinsic value, applicable to historical data statistics, interactive search, accurate marketing, cheat detection, SNS analysis, etc. Cloud Physical Server provided by JD Cloud can provide single-machine 72TB storage. 12 disks are capable of single-disk RAID0, meeting the requirements of Hadoop scenario for large storage capacity and multiple copies. Monopolized high-performance physical server is more suitable for high IO and high CPU demands of big data.

## Virtualization
Enterprises can develop the IT infrastructure toward the orientation of resource sharing by establishing virtualized (such as KVM and Docker) private cloud platforms on OpenStack, so as to give a solution to the issue of performance bottleneck of business peak season under the shared resource environment, improve the business support flexibility of the enterprise’s or the organization’s IT basic architecture, and reduce the complexity of system management. Cloud Physical Server gives maximum freedom to virtual platforms, which is the best choice for setup of dedicated cloud virtual platform.

## Government and enterprise
The government and enterprise core database has extremely high requirements for performance and security. JD CPS meets the user demands for independence, security and high performance, making it easier for enterprise users to deploy their own core databases.

## Game
MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) large-scale cross-service activities will attract a large number of players to join in, having very high requirements for load, stability and network of access server. The life cycle of game applications is short, and quick expansion can be achieved during operation peak relying on the huge resource pool of JD Cloud; at the end of life cycle, dissolution, depreciation and other problems will be faced, and taking advantage of characteristics of purchase by demands and payment by quantities, TCO (total cost of ownership) of the enterprise may be reduced.
