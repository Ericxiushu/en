# Core Concepts

- Cloud Cabinet Service

    Provide high quality IDC cabinet resources for customers to achieve hosted service for their own equipment. The console displays the customer's cabinet, equipment, IP and bandwidth information.
  
- Hoisted Computer Room

    According to the computer room standard of JD Cloud, IDC room resources in different locations are provided for customers. We use the concept of computer room to describe the location of the cabinet you rent. Different computer rooms are completely isolated. You can choose the nearest location. At present, computer room resources are available in cn-north, cn-east and cn-south.

- Hosted Equipment

    After customers rent the cabinets, they can have their own equipment hosted to the JD Cloud room, including but not limited to servers, switches, routers, firewalls, etc.
  
- Hosted Cabinet
 
    JD Cloud provides cabinets of different specifications (cabinet space, rated current, etc.). Customers can choose suitable cabinets for themselves. At present, Cloud Cabinet Service supports the complete cabinet hosting but does not support bulk U hosting.
