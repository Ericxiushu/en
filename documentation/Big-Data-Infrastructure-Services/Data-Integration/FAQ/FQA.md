Q: Does data integration support the products from JD Cloud to synchronize data to DCS?

A: At present, only the object storage service on JD Cloud is supported. RDS can synchronize the data to DCS. Later, on JD Cloud, the function of synchronizing the data to DCS by MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch and HBase, etc. will be added. Stay tuned.
